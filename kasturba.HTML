	<hr>
	<p style=" color: red; ">Kasturba Bhawan, the second Girls Hostel in IIT Roorkee, was established initially as a two-floor building in the year 2006-07. As the time passed and the need to house the increasing number of girl entrants to the instituion increased, it was extended four times and now in its present form is seen as a vibrant seven floored, two winged multi-coloured building inaugrated in 12 November 2010. The name of the bhawan is dedicated to Kasturba Ji, who is a inspiration for all girl residents.The Bhawan has every facility that one needs to live a comfortable life.
It has a state of art Cyber Cafe, managed by students. The place where every girl resident finds her foot is the Bhawan Canteen which serves delicious food at all times. The Bhawan Club has a 21 inch Television with chairs,matresses and tables.It also has a music system. The Bhawan also provides the facility to play various sports such as badminton, table tennis, throw ball etc. by providing various sports equipments free of cost. Along with it, the bhawan also has a seperate washing machine room to help girls meet the daily requirements. We LIVE here, not just to survive but to provide an expression to our lives and this Bhawan is the foundation of it all. It is this place where more than half of our time is spent, and it is this place that serves us as a home, away from our homes. </p>
